# A simple react clock

## Intro
- This is a simple "project" to test react functionalities and resources.
- It will be updated constantly while im learning react with the objective to test features.

## Features
- User should be able to: View a simple clock with no page style, that registers current time and date.

## Made with
- Java Script React
- HTML
- Vite

## Future updates
- This is a placeholder project with the objective to test new features from react when i learn them. Because of this, the project isn't going to remain a simple clock forever, since new features are going to be constantly added.
- My main objective right now is to learn how to use *cases* since using *render* every clock tick is not optimal.
- New objects and features will be constantly added to this README.
